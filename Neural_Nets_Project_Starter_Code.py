# # Gesture Recognition
# In this group project, you are going to build a 3D Conv model that will be able to predict the 5 gestures correctly. Please import the following libraries to get started.

# ## Generator
# This is one of the most important part of the code. The overall structure of the generator has been given. In the generator, you are going to preprocess the images as you have images of 2 different dimensions as well as create a batch of video frames. You have to experiment with `img_idx`, `y`,`z` and normalization such that you get high accuracy.

                    #and the conv3D will throw error if the inputs in a batch have different shapes
                    
                    batch_data[folder,idx,:,:,0] = #normalise and feed in the image

# ## Model
# Here you make the model using different functionalities that Keras provides. Remember to use `Conv3D` and `MaxPooling3D` and not `Conv2D` and `Maxpooling2D` for a 3D convolution model. You would want to use `TimeDistributed` while building a Conv2D + RNN model. Also remember that the last layer is the softmax. Design the network in such a way that the model is able to give good accuracy on the least number of parameters so that it can fit in the memory of the webcam.
